## MW-Links library

This parser uses the python-mwlink library [1] released by MediaWiki. Since
the library is only available a set of utility modules, which is not 
released on PyPi, we copy several of the utility code here. The utility
is licensed under MIT. You can find a copy of the license here.

The MW-links library depends on a couple MediaWiki libraries, which can
be installed via PyPI.
